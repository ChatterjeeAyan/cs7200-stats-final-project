# Using changes in amino-acid characteristics to model disease-association of missense mutations in metalloproteins

We used changes in hydrophobicity, volume, and hydrogen donor/acceptor characteristics of the original and altered amino acid as features to predict whether a missense mutation is disease-associated or benign.
